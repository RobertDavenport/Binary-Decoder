Without even running it, it looks like C code for a pseudo fork bomb. It doesn't actually call fork, but it calls
argv[0]. Argv[0] is the first argument in a command, which in the case of running a program would be the program
name itself. Thus it is an infinite loop which starts another instance of the program each iteration, which then
itself begins spawning more instances of the program, causes memory to be filled up with an exponentially increasing
number of instances of the program.
